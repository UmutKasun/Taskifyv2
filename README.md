# Taskifyv2 â€“ File-Based Java To-Do App

**Taskifyv2** is an advanced version of my previous console-based to-do list app, developed using Java and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.  
Unlike the first version, this application supports persistent storage using `.txt` files. When the app is restarted, all previous tasks are reloaded automatically.

##  Features

-  Add tasks  
-  List all tasks  
-  Mark tasks as completed  
-  Delete tasks  
-  Save & load tasks from file (`tasks.txt`)
